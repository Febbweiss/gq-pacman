gq-pacman is a jQuery implementation of the famous Namco's Pacman.


How to :
--------

Use your keyboard arrows to move Pacman to eat all energizer to complete the level.
Ghosts become frightened when Pacman eats a big energizer. Eat them !!!
                                        
Beware of ghost who haunt the maze !!! Each one has his own personality :
 * Blinky tracks Pacman as his shadow.
 * Pinky perfoms ambushes to Pacman.
 * Inky is the least predictable.
 * Clyde pretends ignorance and is one who lags behind.
